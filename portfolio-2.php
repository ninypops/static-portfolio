                <p>The Hive Honey Shop is a small family-run artisan shop in London. It's ran by beekeepers and award-winning honey enthusiasts. They approached the company I worked for at the time with the goal of updating their <em>very</em> outdated website for one that could handle transactional payments and orders online.</p>

                <p>Some of the infrastructure was already there post-Woocommerce set-up, however the client requested certain custom features that were built-in by myself. The website hosts over 700 products and therefore considerable categorising and taxonomies were added to fit the needs of the client. The website also had to be secure to protect user data and handle payments which was taken care of via SSL Hosting and PayPal integration. More to the front-end, the client wanted Bootstrap galleries to showcase multiple images of their products, stock keeping unit (SKU) to be able to identify the product easier and repetitive navigations for their mature demographic.</p>
