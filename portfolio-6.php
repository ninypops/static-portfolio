                <p>High-end commercial blind and shutters retailer, Halo Interiors were looking for a new website to target the high-end marketplace and strong clientbase.</p>

                <p>This is a family run business in Sutton Coldfield that currently only sells shutters and runs the business from their home. They are opening a new showroom / Shop in January and have decided to branch out to sell not only shutters but also a full range of blinds & curtains.</p>

                <p>They are looking to increase their annual turnover by 25% next year.</p>
