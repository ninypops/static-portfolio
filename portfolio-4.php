                <p>This app was conceptually made by myself, Aimee Gamble-Milner, Elsa Bartley and Rosanna Nichols at Nottingham's annual 24-hour hackathon, <a href="https://www.hack24.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hack24</a>. Innocuous app that provides a discreet and secure way to report and log harassment.</p>

                <p><strong>A transcript taken from <a href="https://blog.helen.digital/wit-notts-at-hack24/" target="_blank" title="Helen Joy Website">Helen Joy</a>:</strong></p>
                <p>"I’m delighted that our WiT teams did so well. Not only were they the poster-child for teamwork, but one of our teams, the Knit-WiTs, won two of the challenges: The Thomson Reuters Do Good with Data and the MHR Easter Egg Hunt. Seeing a team of women who didn’t know each other well, creating an entry that solved a real issue for women made me extremely proud.</p>

                <p>The Knit-Wits entry was an app that people could use to report misogyny. Nottinghamshire police were the first in the country to enable misogyny to be reported as a hate crime, but the process is not made easy for victims. You be Brave, is an app designed to report harassment and abuse and capture the data. Check out the team’s entry video to see how the app works."</p>
